### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite because it got me rather excited for coding. I really enjoyed the dynamic I had with my lab partner which made it more enjoyable. I learned how to do pretty basic arithmetic in it, but a great start.

* Lab 5
   
    Lab 5, part 2 was a favorite because of how challenging it was to do. I struggled greatly figuring out how to do it, but it was great practice for using operators. My partner and I were upset a lot, but were very happy once finished.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was a favorite becuase it was cool being able to utilize text to create a very simple pattern/image. While it looked as though the code would be some frustrating thing to figure out it was far simpler than imagined using iterations. My partner was great as well and very knowledgeable on what was happening and helped me understand it better.
